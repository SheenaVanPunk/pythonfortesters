#Set the value of my_boolean below so that the code below will print
#out the statement 'in if'
my_boolean =
if my_boolean:
    print('in if')
else:
    print ('in else')

# repeat the above code, but this time set the value of my_boolean so 
#that it will print out the statement 'in else'

#Use an if statement to create a code branch that will only be 
#executed if a given variable value is greater than 1

#Create code that will print out 'Greater than 1' if a given variable
#value is greater than one and that will print out 'Less than 1' if 
#the value is less than one and that will print out 'One!' if the value
#is equal to one

#Create code that will only be executed if a given variable value is
#between 0 and 10

#create code that will only be executed if a given variable value is
#less than 0 or greater than 10
